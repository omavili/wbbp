                    of a child's growing brain. During this time, foundations are laid which will

                    eventual career and lifelong wellbeing . This phase is crucial for shaping lifelong
                    health and happiness. Investing during this age period yields an 80% higher
                    return compared to educating them in later years. (Source: Heckman)</div>

                    <p>It's entirely common for children to have varying interests. They often mirror the

                    <p>Some children may take a while to grasp and enjoy the activities. If your child

                    Oral phase is between birth and 18 months. During the oral stage, the infant's
                    primary source of interaction occurs through the mouth, so the rooting and
                    sucking reflex is especially important. The mouth is vital for eating, and the
                    infant derives pleasure from oral stimulation through gratifying activities such as
                    tasting and sucking.
                    Because the infant is entirely dependent upon caretakers (who are responsible
                    for feeding the child), the child also develops a sense of trust and comfort
                    through this oral stimulation.
                    While all the materials within the books are safe for children's health, we
                    strongly recommend that caretakers closely supervise the child during the oral
                    phase.

                    period of time for which a typical child can maintain focus on a given task.
                    Typical attention spans typically follow this pattern:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>2 years old: approximately four to six minutes.</li>
