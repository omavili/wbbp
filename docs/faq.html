                    <p>It's entirely common for children to have varying interests. They often mirror the

                    Oral phase is between birth and 18 months. During the oral stage, the infant's
                    primary source of interaction occurs through the mouth, so the rooting and
                    sucking reflex is especially important. The mouth is vital for eating, and the
                    infant derives pleasure from oral stimulation through gratifying activities such as
                    tasting and sucking.
                    Because the infant is entirely dependent upon caretakers (who are responsible
                    for feeding the child), the child also develops a sense of trust and comfort
                    through this oral stimulation.
                    While all the materials within the books are safe for children's health, we
                    strongly recommend that caretakers closely supervise the child during the oral
                    phase.

                    <p>Childhood development experts generally say that a reasonable attention span
                    to expect of a child is two to three minutes per year of their age. That's the
                    period of time for which a typical child can maintain focus on a given task.
                    Typical attention spans typically follow this pattern:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>2 years old: approximately four to six minutes.</li>
